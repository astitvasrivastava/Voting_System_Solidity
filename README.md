**ONLINE VOTING SYSTEM USING SOLIDITY**

This is a Blockchain based project using the Solidity programming language over Remix-Ethereum IDE to make a Voting system.

Solidity -

Solidity is a programming language specifically designed for developing smart contracts that run on blockchain platforms, with Ethereum being the most prominent example. Smart contracts are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement directly written into code. They automatically enforce and execute these terms when predefined conditions are met.

Smart Contracts:

Solidity is primarily used for writing smart contracts. These contracts are deployed on a blockchain, and their execution is guaranteed by the blockchain's decentralized network.
